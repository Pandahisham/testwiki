## Class : lobule of pinna

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001847
 * *Label* = lobule of pinna
 * *Definition* = The earlobe is, in humans and many other animals, the soft lower part of the external ear. It is the lowermost portion of the human pinna, projecting below the antitragus. The earlobe is composed of tough areolar and adipose (fatty) connective tissues, lacking the firmness and elasticity of the rest of the pinna. Since the earlobe does not contain cartilage the earlobe has a large blood supply and may help to warm the ears and maintain balance but generally earlobes are not considered to have any major biological function.
