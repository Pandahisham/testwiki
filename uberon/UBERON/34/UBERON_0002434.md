## Class : pituitary stalk

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002434
 * *Label* = pituitary stalk
 * *Definition* = The pituitary stalk (also known as the infundibular stalk or simply the infundibulum) is the connection between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary. It carries axons from the magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus down to the posterior pituitary where they release their hormones into the blood. This connection is called the hypothalamohypophyseal tract, and is responsible for the release of oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone[WP].

## Other Annotations

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = A short stalk connecting the pituitary with the brain. Axons of secretory cells in the floor of the diencephalon traverse the infundibulum and terminate in the neurohypophysis.[TAO]
 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = It (the hypophysis) develops embryonically in all vertebrates from two ectodermal evaginations that meet and unite. An infundibulum grows ventrally from the diencephalon of the brain, and Rathke's pouch extends dorsally from the roof of the developing mouth, or stomodaeum. The infundibulum remains connected to the floor of the diencephalon, which becomes the hypothalamus, and gives rise to the part of the gland known as the neurohypophysis. (...) Rathke's pouch loses its connection with the stomodaeum in most adult vertebrates and gives rise to the rest of the gland, the adenohypophysis. (...) A well-developed hypophyseal system with functional connections to the hypothalamus is unique to craniates.[well established][VHOG]
