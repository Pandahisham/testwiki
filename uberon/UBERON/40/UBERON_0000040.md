 * *Definition* = A hemopoietic organ found in elasmobranchs. Along with the spleen and special tissue around the gonads, this structure produces red blood cells and it is nestled along the top and bottom of the esophagus.
 * *Comment* = Taxon notes:  Found in elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) but with some exceptions. Phenotype notes: Leydig's organ can be quite large - a 1.6-kilogram (3.5-pound) one was reported from a 1.8-metre (6-foot) long Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (Hexanchus griseus). Structure notes: divided into dorsal and ventral patches, gradation varies between species. Lacks erythroblasts and fat cells[Honma 1983]
