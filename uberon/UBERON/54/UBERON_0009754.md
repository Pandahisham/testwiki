 * *Label* = blubber
 * *Definition* = a thick layer of vascularized adipose tissue found under the skin of all cetaceans, pinnipeds and sirenians.
 * *Comment* = Lipid-rich, collagen fiber–laced blubber comprises the hypodermis and covers the whole body, except for parts of the appendages, strongly attached to the musculature and skeleton by highly organized, fan-shaped networks of tendons and ligaments. It can comprise up to 50% of the body mass of some marine mammals during some points in their lives, and can range from two inches (5 cm) thick in dolphins and smaller whales, to more than 12 inches (30 cm)thick in some bigger whales, such as right and bowhead whales
