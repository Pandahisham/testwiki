 * *Label* = epineural
 * *Definition* = Some or all epineural bones ossify free from the neural arches in most teleosts. In some lower teleosts, e.g., Leptolepis, Hiodon, elopiforms and albuliforms, ossification proceeds from the attachment point of the ligament to the arch, and the epineural is a process of the neural arch. In many lower teleosts epineurals are forked proximally.
