 * *Label* = appendage girdle complex
 * *Definition* = An organism subdivision that includes both an appendage and its accociated girdle region. Note that this includes both the skeletal elements and associated tissues (integument, muscle, etc).
 * *Comment* = It is still called a complex when one of the two parts is missing (?) There are fossil fishes with only an outgrowth (no record of a girdle), including thelodonts (which have a suprabranchial fin) as well as some anaspids which have a distinctive 'paired fin' (with differing published assertions on whether it's homologous to a pec fin or pelvic fin or both or neither).  There are many fishes and other vertebrates with only a girdle and no outgrowth.[VSAO] AO notes: note that the FMA uses the term 'limb' to refer to the entire appendage complex (free limb plus girdle region)
