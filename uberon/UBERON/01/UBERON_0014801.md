 * *Label* = nuchal line
 * *Definition* = The nuchal lines are four curved lines on the external surface of the occipital bone: The upper, often faintly marked, is named the highest nuchal line, and to it the galea aponeurotica is attached. Below the highest nuchal line is the superior nuchal line. To it is attached the Sternocleidomastoid muscle, Occipitalis muscle, and Splenius capitis muscle, and the trapezius muscle. From the external occipital protuberance a ridge or crest, the median nuchal line, often faintly marked, descends to the foramen magnum, and affords attachment to the ligamentum nuchC&. Running from the middle of this line is the inferior nuchal line. Attached are the Obliquus capitis superior muscle, Rectus capitis posterior major muscle, and Rectus capitis posterior minor muscle.
