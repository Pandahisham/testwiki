 * *Label* = uroneural
 * *Definition* = Neural arch that extends along the dorso-lateral surface of the last preural centra and/or ural centra and the notochord (Arratia & Schultze, 1992). An uroneural develops as a modification of the neural arch of an ural centrum (Patterson, 1968). The series of uroneurals may include from 7 to 1 elements that are numbered from rostrad to caudad. An uroneural is a paired membrane bone.
 * *Comment* = The presence of modified ural neural arches or uroneurals is interpreted as a synapomorphy of Teleostei. Uroneurals present some modifications in certain teleost subgroups and such specialized structures are named pleurostyle (e.g., ostarioclupeomorphs) and stegural (e.g., salmonids).
