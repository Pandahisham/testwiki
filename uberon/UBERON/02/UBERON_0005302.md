 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005302
 * *Label* = female preputial gland
 * *Definition* = The paired, lobulated, modified sebaceous glands located on the side of the clitoris in female rodents; in contrast to the preputial glands in male rodents, clitoral glands are a minor source of olfactory stimuli contributing to sexual attractivity; unlike other sebaceous glands, they undergo progressive atrophy of the glandular portion with marked ductal ectasia as rodents age; there is no true anatomical equivalent in humans[MP].
