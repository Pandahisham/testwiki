 * *Definition* = A posterior projection from proximal rib segments. Offers attachment sites for respiratory and shoulder muscles as well as adding structural support to the trunk skeleton[Kardong 2012].
 * *Comment* = WP: Although bony uncinate processes are unique to birds, cartilaginous uncinate processes are present in crocodiles. The uncinate process has also been reported in Sphenodon, Caudipteryx, oviraptorids, Confuciusornis and Chaoyangia however it does not occur in Archaeopteryx
