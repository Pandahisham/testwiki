 * *Label* = tunica albuginea of testis
 * *Definition* = The Tunica Albuginea is the fibrous covering of the testis. It is a dense blue-white membrane, composed of bundles of white fibrous tissue which interlace in every direction. It is covered by the tunica vaginalis, except at the points of attachment of the epididymis to the testis, and along its posterior border, where the spermatic vessels enter the gland. It is applied to the tunica vasculosa over the glandular substance of the testis, and, at its posterior border, is reflected into the interior of the gland, forming an incomplete vertical septum, called the mediastinum testis (corpus Highmori).

 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = The tunica albuginea testis is the major component of the capsule of mammalian testes. (...) Our results from studying the mole provide evidence that the spatio-temporal pattern of testis development is not perfectly conserved in mammals, since we found differences with respect to the mouse testis organogenesis. This fact is even more significant when we consider that, apart from the mouse, the mole is probably the one of the best-known mammalian species in terms of the genetic control of testis development, implying that more peculiarities would be found if more species were investigated.[uncertain][VHOG]
