## Class : larval stage

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000069
 * *Label* = larval stage
 * *Definition* = a distinct juvenile stage many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle.
 * *Comment* = It is a misunderstanding that the larval form always reflects the group's evolutionary history. It could be the case, but often the larval stage has evolved secondarily, as in insects. In these cases the larval form might differ more from the group's common origin than the adult form[WP]. Uberon includes clade-specific subclasses.
