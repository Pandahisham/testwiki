 * *Definition* = Epipleurals lie below the horizontal septum and are posteroventrally directed. There are ossified epipleurals in certain ostariophysans. In many lower elopocephalan teleosts including ostariophysans the epipleural bones develop an anterodorsal branch so that they are forked proximally.
