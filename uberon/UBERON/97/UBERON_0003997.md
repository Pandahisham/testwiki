## Class : hyoid bone greater horn

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003997
 * *Label* = hyoid bone greater horn
 * *Definition* = the larger and more lateral of the paired processes on either side of the hyoid bone[MP]
 * *Comment* = In humans, the greater cornua are the larger, more lateral projections from the left and right borders of the body of hyoid bone. They are in contrast to the lesser cornua, which also occur in pairs but are comparatively smaller and conical in shape. The greater cornua are derived from the third pharyngeal arches.

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = The greater cornua (or greater horns) of the hyoid bone project backward from the lateral borders of the body; they are flattened from above downward and diminish in size from before backward; each ends in a tubercle to which is fixed the lateral hyothyroid ligament. The upper surface is rough close to its lateral border, for muscular attachments: the largest of these are the origins of the hyoglossus and Constrictor pharyngis medius which extend along the whole length of the cornu; the digastric muscle and stylohyoid muscle have small insertions in front of these near the junction of the body with the cornu. To the medial border the hyothyroid membrane is attached, while the anterior half of the lateral border gives insertion to the thyrohyoid. The greater cornua derive from the 3rd pharyngeal arches[Wikipedia:Greater_cornu].
