 * *Label* = anterior lateral line system
 * *Definition* = The anterior lateral line system develops from cranial ectodermal placodes, situated between the eye and the ear, that give rise to both the neuromasts and the anterior lateral line sensory nerves that innervate the neuromasts. The anterior lateral line system consists of small sensory patches (neuromasts) located superficially on the skin or just under the skin in fluid-filled canals on the head of all fishes and most amphibians and are innervated by several lateral line nerves, which project to the hindbrain. The anterior lateral line system is stimulated by local water displacements and vibrations, and detects propulsion of the fish through the water, as well as facilitating shoaling, prey capture, and predator and obstacle avoidance.
