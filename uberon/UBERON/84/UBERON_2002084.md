 * *Label* = pleurostyle
 * *Definition* = Postero-dorsal process of preural vertebra 1 or postero-dorsal process of the compound terminal centrum. The pleurostyle is a paired membrane bone.
 * *Comment* = The pleurostyle is currently interpreted as a modified pair of uroneurals that fuse to preural vertebra 1 or compound centrum early in ontogeny. However, it is unclear which pair of the series of uroneurals forms the pleurostyle in different teleost subgroups.
