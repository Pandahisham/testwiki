 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = Type of mechanoreceptive organ of the lateral line which are arranged in lines on the body surface. These organs are constituted by hair cells and supporting cells and it is located in the epidermis with its hair cells exposed to the surface. Absent in some caecilians. These receptors receive afferent and efferent innervations.[AAO]
