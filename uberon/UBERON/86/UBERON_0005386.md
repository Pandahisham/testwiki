## Class : olfactory mucosa

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005386
 * *Label* = olfactory mucosa
 * *Definition* = That portion of the nasal mucosa containing the sensory endings for olfaction; the organ of smell[MESH].
 * *Comment* = note uberon uses the term 'mucosa' as 'portion of mucosa', thus the relationship is subclass, not part_of

## Synonyms

 * olfactory area of nasal mucosa
 * olfactory part of nasal mucosa
 * olfactory zone of nasal mucosa
 * pars olfactoria tunicae mucosae nasi
 * pars olfactoria tunicae mucosae nasi

 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = The olfactory mucosa is located in the upper region of the nasal cavity and is made up of the olfactory epithelium and the underlying lamina propria, connective tissue containing fibroblasts, blood vessels, Bowman's glands and bundles of fine axons from the olfactory neurons. The mucus protects the olfactory epithelium and allows odors to dissolve so that they can be detected by olfactory receptor neurons. Electron microscopy studies show that Bowman's glands contain cells with large secretory vesicles. The exact composition of the secretions from Bowman's glands is unclear, but there is evidence that Bowman's glands do not produce odorant binding protein[WP][Wikipedia:Olfactory_mucosa].
