 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = The point at which fibers of the optic nerves cross.[AAO]
 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = The chiasm has been studied in great detail in some animals, while in others relatively little or nothing is known. Although there are some gross architectural features that are conserved within some animals, such as birds and fish, the general picture is one of diversity. This review will attempt to consider the key features of such diversity of chiasmatic organisation in vertebrates and the mechanisms that sculpt them from the limited literature that is available. However, as so much research has been undertaken on the structure and development of the chiasm in laboratory animals, any review must consider the information that has been gleaned from them and hope that future studies will determine whether the features revealed in these animals, and the underlying mechanisms that generate them, have a common vertebrate plan.[uncertain][VHOG]
