## Class : vault of skull

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0004339
 * *Label* = vault of skull
 * *Definition* = Upper part of skull, consisting of parietals, frontals, post-parietals, and in some species the squamosal and a portion of the alisphenoid
 * *Comment* = Editor notes: We follow PMID:11523816 (Morriss-Kay) in definingenumerating the components of the skull vault. Note that there is a conflict with Kardong; e.g. in fig 7.10, Kardong places the squamosal in the temporal series. We cannot place the vault as entirely part of the dermatocranium as it has a small splanchnocranium contribution and a sclerotomal contribution. Terminology notes. we include calvarium as a synonym, but Gray's Anatomy's list includes the Ethmoid and Sphenoid bone in the Calvaria. Some books (and HPO) state that calvaria consists of just the frontal bone, parietal bone, temporal bone, and occipital bone. Note vault may not be precisely equivalent to calvaria
