 * *Label* = lymph vasculature
 * *Definition* = A network of blunt ended vessels lacking direct connection to the blood vascular system. These vessels collect and drain fluids and macromolecules from interstitial spaces throughout the animal. They derive from a subpopulation of endothelial cells and have walls that are much thinner than the blood carrying vessels. Lymphatic vessels are usually classified as either superficial or deep.
