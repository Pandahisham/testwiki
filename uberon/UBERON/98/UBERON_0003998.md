 * *[external_definition](../../UBPROP/01/UBPROP_0000001.md)* = The lesser cornua (or lesser horns) are two small, conical eminences, attached by their bases to the angles of junction between the body and greater cornua of the hyoid bone. They are connected to the body of the bone by fibrous tissue, and occasionally to the greater cornua by distinct diarthrodial joints, which usually persist throughout life, but occasionally become ankylosed. The lesser cornua are situated in the line of the transverse ridge on the body and appear to be morphological continuations of it. The apex of each cornu gives attachment to the stylohyoid ligament; the Chondroglossus rises from the medial side of the base. The lesser cornua are derived from the 2nd pharyngeal arches[Wikipedia:Lesser_cornu].
