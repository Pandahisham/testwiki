 * *Label* = actinopterygian parietal bone
 * *Definition* = Dermal bone that covers the otic region and may articulate with its antimere medially, with the frontal bone anteriorly, the pterotic laterally, the supraoccipital medio-posteriorly, and the epiotic and extrascapula latero-posteriorly. The parietal is a paired bone.[TAO]

 * *[homology_notes](../../UBPROP/03/UBPROP_0000003.md)* = The homologization of cranial bones of actinopterygians with those of sarcopterygians based on the bone names established in human anatomy is favored in order to permit the building of phylogenetic relationship schemes beyond the taxonomic boundaries of osteichthyans (including tetrapods). (...) In actinopterygians, the terms parietal and postparietal bones have to replace the commonly used terms 'frontal' and 'parietal' bones for the two paired bones on the skull roof.[well established][VHOG]
