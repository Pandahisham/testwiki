 * *Definition* = The deep cervical fascia (or fascia colli in older texts) lies under cover of the Platysma, and invests the neck; it also forms sheaths for the carotid vessels, and for the structures situated in front of the vertebral column. Its attachment to the hyoid bone prevents the formation of a dewlap. The investing portion of the fascia is attached behind to the ligamentum nuchC& and to the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra. The 'alar fascia' is a portion of deep cervical fascia.
